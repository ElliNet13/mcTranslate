# MCTranslate

Translate vanilla Minecraft with only a resource pack!

How is this better or worse then a mod like [Translater](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/translater)?
| What about it | MCTranslate | Translater |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| How it runs | Runs as a program | Runs as a mod |
| Mod support | No mod support, ment for vanilla Minecraft | Google Translates other mods too |
| How to add to game | Place the resource pack generated into your resource packs folder and enable | Fabric Modloader, install, you know |

So yeah it's ment for **vanilla** Minecraft, **not** modded.

If you put it in modded Minecraft only vanilla text will be translated.

Can do much more with translate-shell, see node main.js --help for args
